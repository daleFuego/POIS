Your task is to assign movie recomendations using decision tree method applied for each person separately. 
To use this approach both feature vector (representation) of the movies must be generated and set of possible decision 
applicable in decision tree nodes must be selected. The features can be automaticaly extracted using API for TMDB database. 
It may be a good idea to apply some automatic feature selection method to reduce dimensionality of the problem. 
As a result you should submit the following files:

    submission.csv
    features.txt
    tree.png 

The submission.csv file should correspond with task.csv but all the NULL values should be replaced by predicted movie evaluation values. 
The features.txt and tree.png should contain short but clear description of extracted features and image visualizing decision tree for 
a selected person, respectively.

The solution must be submitted as a single zip file which directly (without any unnecessary directory) contains expected deliverables.

It should be assumed that all text files contain an empty line at the end of the file and that the Unix encoding of the end of line character is used.
